# All The Frameworks

There are a great many web development frameworks out there, some of them might be great,
some of them might be terrible, and I don't know which is which. This is [my](https://twitter.com/JellybobUK)
attempt to work out which is which.

## The Challenge

*Implement a moderately complex web application in many frameworks*

By moderately complex, I mean something slightly beyond the typical todo list example
app used to exercise Javascript/CSS frameworks, but not so complex this challenge becomes
unmanageable.

I need to sit down and write up the exact requirements, but it'll be a basic project
management tool, supporting a set of features designed to emulate the sort of things
that are needed in a typical web application:

* CRUD of projects and tasks
* Organisations, billed via Stripe
* Multiple users, managed via a third party auth provider
* File attachments
* Reminders (mostly so that recurring background jobs a thing)
