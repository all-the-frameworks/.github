# All The Frameworks

There are a great many web development frameworks out there, some of them might be great,
some of them might be terrible, and I don't know which is which. This is [my](https://twitter.com/JellybobUK)
attempt to work out which is which.

## The Challenge

*Implement a moderately complex web application in many frameworks*

By moderately complex, I mean something slightly beyond the typical todo list example
app used to exercise Javascript/CSS frameworks, but not so complex this challenge becomes
unmanageable.

I need to sit down and write up the exact requirements, but it'll be a basic project
management tool, supporting a set of features designed to emulate the sort of things
that are needed in a typical web application:

* CRUD of projects and tasks
* Organisations, billed via Stripe
* Multiple users, managed via a third party auth provider
* File attachments
* Reminders (mostly so that recurring background jobs a thing)

## The Rules

If there's a recommended path for doing something in a given framework, I'll take that
path. If a framework wants me to do all the UI as a Javascript SPA in React, I'll do that.
If it wants me to generate HTML server side, that's how it'll be done. Where there isn't
a recommended path I'll try to use whatever seems to be the most highly recommended library
for a given purpose. If that doesn't work, I'll just do whatever seems best.

## Rating Frameworks

Rating is entirely subjective, but I'll try to write up some notes of how I'm finding each
framework as a work through using it, and a summary of how I found it afterwards. Keep in
mind that my background is largely one of startups and design agencies, so I'm biased towards
things that let me get lots done with minimal effort.
